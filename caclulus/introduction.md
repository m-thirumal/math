### Introduction

Calculus is the mathematics of motion and change, where there is a motion or growth, where variables forces are at work producing acceleration, Calculus is the right mathematics to apply

#### Differential Calculus

Dealt with the problem of calculating rate if change. It enables us to define a slopes of curves, to claculate velocities and accelerations of moving bodies, to find firing angles that would give cannons their greatest range, and to predict the times when planets would be closest together or farther apart.

`dx` means - little bit of `x` (or) an element of `x`

`âˆ«dx` means - sum of all little bit of `x` or integral of `x`

#### Integral Calculus

Dealt with the problem of determining a function from the information about it's rate of change. It enables us to calculate the future location of a body from it's present position and a knowledge of the forces actiong on it, to find the areas of irregular regions in the plane, to measure the lengths of curves and to find the volumes and masses of aribitary solid.
